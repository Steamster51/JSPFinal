                Bite of TO is dedicated to bringing you the best food that Toronto (and neighbouring cities) has to offer.
                Whether you are a local Torontonian or a tourist who is looking to explore the beautiful city of Toronto, we are here to help you hunt down the best places to eat in town!
                The beauty of Toronto is we are known to be one of the most diversified cities in the world. That means we are fortunate to have access to a list of best restaurants allowing us to experience a variety of cuisines inspired by different countries around the world.
                Whenever youre craving for the most popular Asian, Indian, Caribbean, European, or home to North American dishes, Bite of TO has you covered!
                We realize that finding the best cuisines and places to eat is not easy because lets face it, not everything is a one-size fits all and that can be very frustrating!
                We all grew up differently. Everyone comes from different cultures and have different taste buds, so we all have our own preferences when it comes to what we define as good-tasting finger-licking foods.
                Some like their food with extra spice and numbness packed with intense flavours. While others prefer their food with no spice, less spice, or lighter flavours.
                We also have those seeking vegetarian options and sometimes go to the next level with vegan options. Then we have the meat lovers who prefer to go all out on the meat.
                Now lets talk about the extreme picky eaters.
                We know there are picky eaters who are all about taste, experience, and heavy calories. They do not care how unhealthy it is, so they do not feel guilty at all YOLO!
                On the other end of the spectrum, we have picky eaters who make all their food choices based on ingredients and healthy eating. These health-conscious people try to eat as healthy as possible and maybe limit their guilty pleasures to one ot two times a week if any.
                Not only that, but some only care about price and look for the cheapest foods. Whereas others do not mind paying as long as the quality and experience justifies it.
                As you can see, you just can not satisfy everyone because no one person is the same when it comes to choosing the best foods.
                But here is how we can help you find and choose the best places to eat in Toronto that will suit your taste buds
